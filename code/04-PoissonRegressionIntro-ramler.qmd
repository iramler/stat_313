```

Explore by age and location

```{r}
sumStats2 <- fHH1 |> 
  group_by(age, location) |>
  summarise(n = n(),
            mntotal = mean(total),
            vartotal = var(total),
            logmntotal = log(mntotal)
            )

ggplot(sumStats2, aes(x = age, y = logmntotal, color = location)) +

  xlab("Age of head of the household") +
  ylab("Log empirical mean household size")

```

Explore by Age and Roof Material

```{r}
sumStats3 <- fHH1 |>
  group_by(age, roof) |> 
  summarise(n = n(),
            mntotal = mean(total),
            vartotal = var(total),
            logmntotal = log(mntotal)
            )

ggplot(sumStats3, aes(x=age, y=logmntotal, color=roof)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se=FALSE) +
  xlab("Age of head of the household") +

```

## Poisson Regression Models

1.  Propose and fit a Poisson regression model that uses age to predict mean total number in household.

```{r}
mod1 = glm(total ~ age, family = "poisson", data=fHH1)
summary(mod1)
confint(mod1, level = 0.95)
```

a.  Is there evidence that age is a useful predictor in the model?

```{r}
# Reminder of where the p-value comes from
2 * pnorm(-5.026, mean = 0, sd = 1)
```

b.  Provide an interpretation of the estimated coefficient on age, in context.

c.  Construct and interpret a 95% confidence interval for population coefficient on age.

d.  Explore the poisson regression deviance residuals plot.

```{r}
plotPoissonDevRes(mod1)
```

# Prep for Wednesday Task: Finish 2 a - d

2.  Propose and fit a Poisson regression model that uses a quadratic function of age to predict mean total number in household.

```{r}
mod2 = glm(total ~ age + I(age^2), data=fHH1,
           family = "poisson")
summary(mod2)

```

a.  Is there evidence that the quadratic term is useful in the model?

b.  Compute a 95% confidence interval for the relative risk associated with the quadratic term.

```{r}
confint(mod2) |> exp()
```

c.  Does the Poisson deviance residuals plot suggest this model has better fit?

```{r}
plotPoissonDevRes(mod2)
```

d.  Compare AIC for Model 1 and Model 2? Which model does AIC suggest is better?

```{r}
AIC(mod1)
AIC(mod2)
```

e.  Is there evidence that the overall model is useful?

```{r}
summary(mod2)
```

```{r}
pchisq(161.6, 2, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

3.  Propose and fit a Poisson regression model that uses a quadratic function of age, as well as location and roof material to predict the mean total number in the household.

```{r}
table(fHH1$location)

mod3 <- glm(total ~ age + I(age^2) + location + roof, 
            data = fHH1, family = "poisson")
summary(mod3)
```

a.  Is there evidence that the overall model is useful?

```{r}
pchisq(2362.5 - 2186.6, 1499-1492, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

b.  Is there evidence that roof material is useful in the model?

```{r}
summary(mod3)
```

4.  Propose and fit a Poisson regression model that uses location and a quadratic function of age to predict the mean total number in the household.

```{r}
mod4 = glm(total ~ age + I(age^2) + location, family="poisson", data=fHH1)
summary(mod4)

```

a.  Is there evidence that the location terms significantly improve the model? Address this question with a single hypothesis test.

```{r}
summary(mod2)
```

```{r}
pchisq(13.1, 4, lower.tail = FALSE)
```

```{r}
anova(mod2,mod4, test="Chisq")
```

b.  Summarize the findings about difference in the mean total number in the household between the different locations.

```{r}
fHH1 = mutate(fHH1, locationfac = as.factor(location))

mod4 = glm(total ~ age + I(age^2) + locationfac, family="poisson", data=fHH1)


library(multcomp)
summary( glht(mod4, mcp(locationfac="Tukey")) )

```
